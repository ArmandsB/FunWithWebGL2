# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 111 - Quaternion Cone Constraint
**Description**:
In this video we start exploring ways to limit the amount of rotation that can be done with our armature. Today we try our hand at trying to setup a cone constraint that will limit how much rotation that can be applied and if the rotation is over the limit, snap the rotation to the closests point of the cone' base.
