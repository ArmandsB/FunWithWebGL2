# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 129 - Spring Bone Chain
**Description**:
In the previous lesson we learned how to build a jiggle bone. In todays lesson,
we're going to expand it by applying the concept to an array of bones. This gives
us the ability to start animationg specific things like hair, clothing, tails,
whatever use you can think of that is skinned with a chain of bones.
